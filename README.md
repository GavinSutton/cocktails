Cocktails


Hey! Thanks for visiting. 

Pick Your Poison is a simple JavaScript app I made while in the accelated JavaScript course at Juno College of Technology. 

Some backstory: 
I'm not a huge drinker, but I do have a huge sweet tooth. Because of that, cocktails have always been my drink of choice - but I've always kept things pretty simple because I'm pretty awful in the kitchen. Rye and Ginger, Gin and Soda. Dark and Stormy's are my favourite (I've been hunting down the best Dark And Stormy in Toronto, and so far BarChef's is the best I've found). I thought it'd be fun to try out more recipes. Since I'm no drink expert, and I don't know the names of many drinks, I decided the easiest way to discover new cocktails is at random. So this app relies on only one thing â€” choose the booze you got on hand, and make whatever pops up. 

Big thanks to the Cocktails Database for providing the API!
